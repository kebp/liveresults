EmmaClient is a client-server system for publishing liveresults from Orienteering events.

This project is forked from Peter Löfås's [liveresults](https://github.com/petlof/liveresults).

New and improved features compared to original project introduced to support the requirements of WOC2024 are:

* Allow use of finish position data from a photo finish to sort results.
* Allow choice of 1/10 second timing in event setup.
* Reduced refresh interval for sprint races.
